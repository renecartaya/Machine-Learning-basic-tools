# Machine-Learning-fundamental-tools

The current repository consist of a set of projects for basic Machine Learning applications including:

 1) Regression set
 2) Classification set
 3) Clustering set
 4) Sentiment Analysis set
 5) Recommender system set
 6) Natural Language Processing
 7) Artificial Neural Network

Some of the datasets used in the examples here are borrowed from Jos√© Portilla from Pierian Data. 

The folder includes some set of data to be used as sample for the testing of the tools, as is the case of the files:

 1) Adverstising.csv
 2) hearing_test.csv
 3) gene_expression.csv

Additionally, this repository includes the implementation of Machine Learning algorithms for Signal Processing including:
 
 1) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method
 2) Power Spectral Density technique
 3) Auto-correlation function
 4) Wavelet Transform
 5) Neural Networks
